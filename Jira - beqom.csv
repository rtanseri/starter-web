implemented security (across the system) is based on the current comp round. Even if you select the previous comp round in the report filters, you’ll see employees you’re eligible for this year, 

I remember we had the US to split security per comp round and use historical security. Although, I can’t find it now. [~accountid:557058:f422a208-346f-422f-8b71-c34d537588a0] do you remember what were the last agreements?","20/juil./22 9:49 AM;557058:f422a208-346f-422f-8b71-c34d537588a0;[https://pictet-spf01.atlassian.net/browse/BEQ-3083|https://pictet-spf01.atlassian.net/browse/BEQ-3083|smart-link]

I suspected this answer, I find it confusing then to have the choice to be able to select a past CR but that will be based on the active population of the present CR.
Would it be possible to set the query on the population of the past CR and not on the current one? Because as it is, there is no improvement compared to Onyx, and this is annoying for the creation, the analysis of historical report.

We need to discuss  with CAS team how we can review the security based on historical data.

Indeed today we do not store the settings of 2021 in any table and therefore the population that you see today will be the people you are allowed to see in historical rounds.



If you need to have access to historical data we need to define some rules OR store at the end of each CR the population you were allow to see before switching to the new round.

Lets plan a meeting [~accountid:62615435f698310070a9259a] with CAS and Steven.",22/juil./22 11:23 AM;62615435f698310070a9259a;Update: Call will take place on 26. July  at 2pm. ,"27/juil./22 3:06 PM;557058:f422a208-346f-422f-8b71-c34d537588a0;*Specs:* We need to review the way security is handled for Historical rounds.

+*A - Current Situation:*+

Users have access to a specific population as of the *YEP effective Date i.e 31/12/2022*. Those users would have access to all historical comp data of *THOSE people* 

*Example:* 

User A has access to Population PAM

* The User A would have access to all employees who are PAM as of 31 12 2022 *for the current comp round*
* Same view on historical data : that would mean if an employee was PAS in the past and is PAM as of 31 12, *the user A would see him*

+*B- New request:*+

* Users have access to a specific population as of the *YEP effective Date i.e 31/12/2022*. Those users would have access to all employees who were PAM in the past for historical round (as of 31 12 N-1, N-2 etc)

*Example:* 

User A has access to Population PAM

* The User A would have access to all employees who are PAM as of 31 12 2022  *for the current comp round*
* On the historical data, the user A should have access to ALL employees who were PAM for the historical round  (as of 31 12 N-1, N-2 etc)



This would request a new procedure to calculate, for all rounds what was the population as of the end of the year



*TO DO:*



+1 - Generate security rows for one prior round+

* Create a new Stored Procedure named : *_sp_global_population_object_security_comp_**round*
** Parameters
*** @CompRoundId INT
* Retrieve data from the table *_tb_Global_Profile_Security_Assignment_YEP*  (for the Active Round and not the CompRoundId passed in parameter)
** Extract the criteria of the selected population
** Get the criteria of the population and add / update the Comp Round at the end of the clause to use the comp round ID passed in parameter in the SP @CompRoundId

Example, for comp round 2019:

* Population criteria is 

!image-20220727-112831.png|width=1046,height=300!

* Extract the criteria and update the comp roud name to be 2019

(\[Organizational data.Legal Entity Name]= \['Pictet Asset Management (Japan) Ltd.']AND\[Organizational data.Department Name]<>\['Human Resources']AND \[Comp [Round.Name|http://Round.Name]]= \['YEP{color:#ff5630}*2019']*{color})



* Apply this criteria on the YEP universe view of the population 



* If CompRound is an historical comp round (check is active flag from CompRound Referential)
** MERGE to refresh the table
** Store the outcome of that population in a new table named *_tb_Global_Population_Object_Security_Historical_CompRound* having the following structure
*** CompRoundId INT
*** UserId INT
*** ProfileId INT
*** PayeeId INT
*** HrId INT
*** Pernr INT
*** SecurityType NVARCHAR 20 = *YEP*
** {color:#bf2600}*REMOVE the user / payee row as a user MUST NOT SEE ITS DATA*{color}
* If CompRound is the active round (check is active flag from CompRound Referential)
** Store the outcome of that population in a new table named *_tb_Global_Population_Object_Security_Active_CompRound* having the following structure
*** CompRoundId INT
*** UserId INT
*** ProfileId INT
*** PayeeId INT
*** HrId INT
*** Pernr INT
*** SecurityType NVARCHAR 20 = *YEP*
** {color:#bf2600}*REMOVE the user / payee row as a user MUST NOT SEE ITS DATA*{color}



+2 - General Action to refresh historical security rows+

An action has to be created and can be executed manually

!image-20220727-125236.png|width=1571,height=847!

=> Refresh Historical Security Access

This action will loop through all prior comp round and will populate the table with the tasks defined in the TO DO +1 - Generate security rows for one prior round+

* Create a SP named *_sp_global_population_object_security_historical_comp_**round_all*
** Loop through all historical comp rounds (i.e IsActive = 0) from CompRound referential table
** Call the SP *_sp_global_population_object_security_comp_**round* and pass the CompRoundId 

+3- Create a new Security View that will do the following+

Return the following columns

* CompRoundId 
* UserId 
* ProfileId 
* PayeeId 
* HrId 
* Pernr 
* SecurityType 



The view should do a UNION ALL of the following and should be named *_vw_YEP_Security_CompRound*

First Part : *Active Comp Round*

Get the values from the table *_tb_Global_Hierarchy_Object_Security* for the current active comp round filtered on YEP security type

Second Part : *Historical Comp Round*

Get the values from the table *_tb_Global_Population_Object_Security_Historical_CompRound* , filtered on YEP security type



+4 - Change Massive Export Security check+

The Massive Export report has to be changed and the security should do a lookup on the view *_vw_YEP_Security_CompRound*

on the CompRound, User, Profile to identify who are the employee a user is supposed to have access to.



+5 - Change HR Budget Monitoring report+

The Massive Export report has to be changed and the security should do a lookup on the view *_vw_YEP_Security_CompRound*

on the CompRound, User, Profile to identify who are the employee a user is supposed to have access to.



{color:#bf2600}*NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL WORKS ONLY FOR THE PROFILE SECURITY WHERE WE HAVE THE TOP NODE PICTET GROUP SELECTED*{color}

{color:#bf2600}*In PROD and PP this is ALWAYS the CASE  but if ONE DAY someone needs to give an access at a specific node, that proposal has to be reviewed (we would need  to store the HIstorical Tree anytime before doing the switch).*{color}

* for the current comp round i.e CR 2022 in that case, the score is coming from the YEP Grid and if you see 0% its because in the YEP its empty or 0 (it should be populated from BSC)

!image-20220905-130746.png|width=576,height=453!

if there was some values, it would not equal to 0.



* for the next round, if the employee has a target bonus as of 01 04 2023, we set the value to 100% otherwise we make it empty.

So we do not set the value to 0% in the current round : it depends on the Process Grid value - and if nothing is populated in the YEP grid it will equal to 0.

However, as we changed the load of data due to BSC (removal of Employee Additional information grid), people who ARE NOT in BSC would have their total score always empty.

what is not normal is to have a *score* at 100% by default in the line 2023 and the problem is here because it creates an inconsistency.

I need to clarify that one with [~accountid:5f47e7ec9a013100410bf481] when he is back as its clashing with the initial request:



*IF PA9008_TARBO_ADJ <> PA9008_TARBO_T (*{color:#bf2600}*excepted if PA9008_TARBO_ADJ = 0)*{color}

*OR Employee is in DCM calculation Grid*

*THEN we display payroll*

*ELSE payroll view not to display*

I need to understand the meaning of {color:#bf2600}*excepted*{color}. 

Does it mean we need to show IF equals to 0 ? Or if equals we do not show?

So if *PA9008_TARBO_ADJ* <> *PA9008_TARBO_T* AND {color:#bf2600}*PA9008_TARBO_ADJ*{color} <> 0

OR  *PA9008_TARBO_ADJ* <> *PA9008_TARBO_T* OR ({color:#bf2600}*PA9008_TARBO_ADJ*{color} = 0)

And in this specific case the tourniquet will show on the target view a positive amount of target to pay (17 k * 95% = 16,15 K) whereas in reality the payroll amount calculated behind (Short term incentive bonus) +*is ZERO*+ (based on adjusted Target Bonus).

And the problem with the current rule of the display of the payroll view is that we don’t see that the amount to announce is ZERO. So I just want that we refine the display rule of the payroll view to ensure that this case is captured.

To reply to the question with the term “Except”, please could you give me the the ticket number where I wrote this: I would like to know in which context I added it, but I think it was to avoid to display the payroll in the mainly cases where there is an amount of Target bonus in package view, and adjusted at zero and the perf at Zero. 

So, to conclude yes Raymond you are right, this 2 request are apposite and to solve it I propose to refine like this: 

*on display la payroll*

*IF PA9008_TARBO_ADJ <> PA9008_TARBO_T excepted in case where PA9008_TARBO_ADJ = 0 and Perf = 0*

etc…

But for the guaranteed bonus I don’t know why I put the rule *(*{color:#bf2600}*excepted if PA9008-GUAR_ADJ = 0*{color}*)*, does make not sense, so I need to definitively read the concerned ticket if you (Raymond) can find it.","02/août/22 2:01 PM;557058:f422a208-346f-422f-8b71-c34d537588a0;[~accountid:5f47e7ec9a013100410bf481]

We used to display only Yes or Nothing, now we would like to display a specific Label depending on the status of the employee.

2 Options: 

We have to create a new field OR extend the TEXT to handle more than 3 characters

*Option A:* 

* Changes in 
** \[*_tb_YEP_ProcessGrid_Data_Repository_Budget_Calculation*] : Extend number of characters of the LeaverFlag column
** \[*_tb_YEP_ProcessGrid_Data_Repository*] : Extend number of characters of the LeaverFlag column
** Some BSC Procedures and tables are also re-using the Leaver Flag, we have to alos impact those ones.
*** _tb_BSC_Final_Scoring

*Option B:* 

* Change the leaver flag to show Yes if we fall into one of the listed cases below
* Add a new column named Leaver Type OR Mobility that would display the details of the Leaver



*I would suggest to go with Option B taking into consideration regression and impacts*



Last question is: Can we use the PERNR of the Eligible employee as of 31 12 N?

*TO DO:*

* Add a new colum in *_tb_YEP_ProcessGrid_Data_Repository* named *MobilityFlag* VARCHAR(255)
* Change Refresh in *_sp_YEP_Data_Repository_Refresh* to populate the new mobility field based on the rules provided : we need to lookup both pernr as of 31 dec and as of 1st april coming from Eligible table 
* Change in *_vw_YEP_ProcessGrid_Template* to add the new added column
* Add column *MobilityFlag* in the Process Grid
* Manage visibility
** Remove the column LeaverFlag
** Add the column Mobility Flag
* Reset all views

 I already ask some HRBPs/BL comp and for now, we would need a workshop and do deeper analysis with DPO.

HR Bl comp wants to have a “Comment” field with free text and no dropdown list (they say it’s too restrictive and it doesn’t fit to all BL needs) to be able to: 

* comment the compliance breaches and the associated bonus reductions (PAM) or 
* insert details about double currency bonuses (PAM) or 
* justify why would a Manager put 0 bonus to an employee (CF) or 
* justify why a Manager would give y bonus (T&O) or 

So the comment need would be a general free text. But I would need to check with DPO if if’s ok. and then confirm the needs

I expressed it in Post Yep improvement about adding a comment column with free text. But I see that this ticket is from last year. 

And there is a confusion / misunderstanding of the improvement that is sought.
The aim here is to have a free text area to avoid having to keep a *milk book* which often generates errors. In my opinion, the drop down list does not meet the need expressed by HRPBs.

To answer Raymond's questions, it seems to me that we already clarified them during the workshop sessions.

Positioning in the YEP Grid I would tend to place it at the end before the Local Manager block. To be validated with others.

!image-20220617-142801.png|width=1048,height=134!

For the label title: *YEP Comments*


For the drop down list can't we have a table where we can adjust the available values?
For the moment my guess are: Capping, Performance Issue, Outlier, Compliance Breach, Increase to be considered next year, Mobility with Split.

*Note*: this is a look-a-like “control” table but remember this is a report



Based on the comments in the description and to cover all cases:

* CHF is mandatory (PWM, Anne)
* Max of CCY displayed for the current population:(PAM, T&Ops)
* Currency of the manager / HRBP logged in (CCY determined through the Country of the user ) (Claudia, Leslie, Sylvie)
* Do you need another CCY by default?


if the CCY is the same for all cases, we will not give the ability to switch CCY, but  just display the CCY in the table



Then if the user wants to display the report in the CCY, he would have to click on the corresponding CCY to select the CCY.

As an example below, this would be a list of radio button and CCY displayed:

* CHF =>(default)
* EUR => Max CCY
* GBP => Manager CCY

1 - To be changed in Team Comparison:

* Change in the RDL file to have a CCY passed as parameter
* Manage table to checked / unchecked the corresponding CCY
* After checking one CCY, pass the parameter to the SPs used in Team Comparison report
* Convert the amounts in the SP by using the parameter
